				<h3>We keep an open line of communication.</h3>
				<p>
					Transparency is one of our core values. We believe keeping an open line of communication with you is fundamental to the success of your project. Throughout the entire project (design to completion) you will have 24hr access to the schedule and daily logs. You will also receive a weekly invoice and budget update indicating where costs have been incurred and the balance required until project completion. Attached to each budget update is a copy of all invoices for that week. This allows you to review every financial details keeping the entire process transparent.

				<h3>Time is money. We take both of yours seriously.</h3>

					After we have spent time getting to know you and your proposed project, we will create a feasibility plan. This plan outlines the high level scope of work, schedule and budget discussed during discovery. During this meeting we will present both a preliminary design and construction budget as well as the design and construction agreement. This is a significant investment for clients and it is imperative that we respect your budget and set realistic expectations around it.
