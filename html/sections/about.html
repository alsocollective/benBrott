	<h2>A message from our cheif</h2>
	<h4>
		Thank you for taking the time to read The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences’ (DOVS) first annual report. We rely on the support of donors, partners, and interested parties like you to continue our mission to promote children’s eye health and treat eye diseases by integrating research, education and clinical care.

		<p>
			Vision is one of the primary means we have for understanding and appreciating the world. From the feeling we get when we see a loved one’s smile, to the way it helps us complete complex tasks, vision is one of the essential senses that drives human life. The contribution you make to our mission to improve visual outcomes truly changes lives. 
			<br><br>
			The DOVS clinical program is one of the largest in the world, with over 20,000 patients seen every year. We are the only centre in Canada that offers comprehensive paediatric ophthalmology services covering all subspecialties, and are Canada’s leading resource for providing complex eye care for children, including advanced surgical interventions. Many of our physicians have formal training in multiple disciplines and are thought leaders in their fields. Our clinical program is also supported by a dedicated and experienced team of allied health-care professionals. 
		</p>
		<p class="colapsible hidden">
			<br>
			Our research programs are internationally renown, with an excellent track record of productivity. We strive to translate our research to the bedside to provide the highest quality and most innovative care to all our patients. We collaborate closely with other SickKids departments through our research, and also offer opportunities for our students to participate in research development.
			<br><br>
			The SickKids DOVS is affiliated with the University of Toronto (U of T) and is actively engaged in training postgraduate medical learners and graduate students. We provide comprehensive training to ophthalmologists that go on to work all over the globe. We have also launched a Global Care and International Ophthalmology initiative that is driving the development of collaborative health-care solutions worldwide.
			<br><br>
			In this report, you will learn about our successes and the challenges we face. I hope that it will reaffirm your commitment to our cause and the importance of our mission. Together, we can work to improve outcomes for children and families living with a variety of eye diseases.
			<br><br>
			Thank you for your contribution to our mission, no matter what form it takes.
			<br><br>
			Sincerely,
			<br><br>
			Dr. Agnes Wong
