		<h2>Telemedicine and ROP</h2>
		<p>
			Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a disorder that primarily affects premature babies. The smaller a child is, the more likely they are to develop ROP, typically in both eyes. ROP is one of the most common causes of loss of vision for children, and can lead to lifelong impairment or blindness.<br><br>
			SickKids has driven the alternative use of a specialized camera to capture photographs of the interior surface of the eye, which can then be sent to expert ophthalmologists for diagnosis. While ophthalmic imaging is a skill that requires specialized training, SickKids has been successful in using live, two-way audio-video connections to train nurses to capture these images, even if they have no experience in ophthalmology or ophthalmic photography. This research has been a corner stone for the development of the Ontario ROP Telemedicine Program, which helps train neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) nurses already working in remote hospitals to learn this new skill.<br><br>
			These research-based programs have not only created significant reductions in health-care costs, they have also eliminated the potential for death that occurs when premature infants need to be transferred between treatment centres.
