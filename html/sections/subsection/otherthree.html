			Child eye care advocacy
		</h2>
		<p>
			Children are not small adults — their eyes are different and require proper development to be healthy. Our Child Eye Care Advocacy research program develops unique and effective eye care strategies that are critical for promoting excellent vision.<br><br>
			Research on strategies that improve overall health is of growing interest for decision makers when allocating resources. Our long-term goal is to devise the best and most cost-effective eye care strategies for children of all ages in Ontario.

			Ocular Genetics
		</h2>
		<p>
			The field of Ocular Genetics has grown significantly in the last decade, with over 300 genes now associated with diseases of the eye. We are one of the largest users of genetic testing in Canada. This has allowed us to decipher the basis of several eye disorders through our research. <br><br>
			Dr. Héon leads numerous genetic studies of eye disorders that are present at birth and deteriorate over time, known as retinal dystrophies. Our patients have benefitted from access to the earliest clinical trials of new therapeutic interventions, such as gene replacement therapy. The application of innovative therapies to treat inherited forms of blindness is rapidly evolving, and we are prepared to be active players in this exciting new era.

			Surgical innovation
		</h2>
		<p>
			Surgical Innovation is a research program that focuses on techniques to improve the management of various kinds of vision loss, including trauma, severe retinal damage, and deformities of the eye existing at birth. <br><br>
			This means introducing new techniques and instrumentation, improving ways of planning surgery using imaging, and reviews of surgical outcomes. The goal of the program is to improve care for these patients, many of whom have very complex problems that demand unconventional solutions. Innovative techniques developed and studied in our department include conventional and selective corneal transplantation, ocular surface reconstruction and glaucoma surgery.
